    <h1>Error Types in Programming</h1>
    <p>Understanding different types of errors is crucial for effective debugging and coding. Here are some common error types:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Syntax Errors:</strong> These occur when the code violates the rules of the programming language. For example, missing a semicolon or parentheses.</li>
        <li><strong>Runtime Errors:</strong> These happen during the execution of the program, such as trying to divide by zero or accessing an undefined variable.</li>
        <li><strong>Logical Errors:</strong> These are mistakes in the program's logic that lead to incorrect results, even though the code runs without crashing.</li>
        <li><strong>Type Errors:</strong> These occur when an operation is performed on incompatible data types, such as adding a string to a number.</li>
        <li><strong>Compilation Errors:</strong> These are detected by the compiler before the program runs, often due to syntax issues or type mismatches.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By recognizing and understanding these error types, developers can more effectively troubleshoot and resolve issues in their code.</p>

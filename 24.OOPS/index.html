    <h1>Welome to OOPS Concepts</h1>
    <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", 
    which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).</p>
    <h2>Key Concepts of OOP</h2>  
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> Bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class.</li>
        <li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.</li>
        <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> A mechanism where a new class can inherit properties and methods from an existing class.</li>
        <li><strong>Polymorphism:</strong> The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface, typically by overriding methods.</li>
        </ul>
